### Realtime request and offer fucntionality

There'd be a page where user can make a request.

The request would have some fields like:
- Title
- Description
- Category
- (university) which we already know from the user's model!

The request would be sent to the merchant in the same university.

User can tracj the amoutn of merchants who views a request!

The merchant can then make an offer.

The user can then accept the offer.

The offer would have some fields like:
- Price
- Description
- (university) which we already know from the user's model!

The user can then accept the offer.

The offer would be sent to the user.

So we are creating a realtime request and offer functionality!

Its gonna have  4 pages:
- Request page (for users to make a request)
- Request details page (for users to see the request details, number of views and accept or reject offers)
- The merchant page where they can see the request and make an offer
- The offers page where the user can see all the offers and accept or reject them

if a user is to accept an offer, the user can send a message to the merchant.

so design these pages staring with the request page. it should be usng my current design system. with lotta icons and emojis! and very very beautiful and modern!
Then we can proceed with the other pages.
